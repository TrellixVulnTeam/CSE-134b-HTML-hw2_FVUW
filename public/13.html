<h1>Team Findings</h1>

	<ol>
<li>Note on onkeypress: Note: The onkeypress event is not fired for all keys (e.g. ALT, CTRL, SHIFT, ESC) in all browsers. To detect only whether the user has pressed a key, use the onkeydown event instead, because it works for all keys.
</li>
<li>Also, holding a key down triggers onkeydown rather than onkeypress. If anything, would think for one key hold, it would be one onkeydown event, one onkeyup event, and many onkeypress events in between.
</li>
<li>Onmouseout vs. onmouseleave
Onmouseout works when you mouse off of the element or its child elements but onmouseleave is only fired when you mouse off of the attributed element
</li>
<li>onmousewheel
Deprecated. The onmousewheel attribute is deprecated, you should use the onwheel attribute instead 
</li>
<li>GET vs. POST
When creating forms, we realized that there was 2 ways to collect the form information. ‘Get’ will store all the data in the URL of the page, while ‘post’ will request a web server to accept the data. ‘Post’ would likely be better if the data is not supposed to be public.
</li>
<li>Styling elements
I realized that you can add styles within an HTML document to change the appearance of elements without adding an external CSS document. Elements will typically have many different styling attributes.
</li>
<li>'pre' tag
Usually HTML will ignore spacing like newlines and tabs, but I learned that the 'pre' tag in HTML will assume that the text is preformatted and leave the spacing in its original form.
</li>
<li>'ruby' tag
I learned that you can use foreign characters with the 'ruby' tag in HTML. It is useful because it will preserve the correct format associated with those characters (Arabic, Chinese, etc.)
</li>
<li>For certain browsers (Chrome), the 'embed' and 'iframe' tags do not work.
</li>

Is the Ending Slash Optional?
HTML5: the slash is optional.
HTML4: the slash is technically invalid. However, it's accepted by W3C's HTML validator.
XHTML: The slash is REQUIRED.
I recommend to always add the slash. Because, it provides a visual clue of non-closing tags. It's also convenient if you write simple script to check your HTML, without a lookup table or using heavy HTML parser.
